Want to contribute? Great! First, read this page (including the small print at
the end).

### Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual?csw=1)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other things -- for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.

### Pytype dependencies
Before you can build and test Pytype, you will have to install a few
dependencies.

1. __A C++11 compiler for your platform__: Pytype uses extension modules.
   A C++11 compiler is required to build these extension modules.
2. __[CMake](https://cmake.org) version 2.8 or higher__: To build the extension
   modules and to run tests in parallel, Pytype makes use of a CMake based
   build system.
3. __[Bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) version 3.0.2 or higher__:
   Pytype uses a custom parser to parse PYI files. This parser is implemented
   using Flex and Bison.
4. __[Flex](https://www.gnu.org/software/flex/) version 2.5.35 or higher__
5. __[ninja build](https://ninja-build.org/)__: Pytype's test utility scripts
   make use of ninja as the CMake generated build system. NOTE: if you
   have a [ninja Python distribution](https://pypi.org/project/ninja/) installed
   and active, you can skip installing the official ninja distribution.
6. __Python2.7 and Python3.x Interpreters__: A large subset of Pytype's
   functional tests analyse the target (the Python source code that is being
   analyzed by Pytype) twice: once as if it were Python2.7 code, and another
   time as if it were in the Python 3.x version that pytype is running under.
   Hence, to run these tests, you will need Python 2.7 and Python 3.x
   (preferably 3.6+) interpreters installed on your system.

Required Python packages are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file
in this repository. This can be done with pip with the following command:

```
$> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The Pytype Git repository also contains few Git submodules. Before building
the `pytype` executable or running tests, one has to ensure that the submodules
are up to date. This can be done with the following command:

```
$> git submodule update --init
```

### Building `pytype` and other executables
The executables like `pytype` etc. are built using a convenience script as
follows:

```
$> python build_scripts/build.py
```

`build.py` will build the executables in the `out/bin` directory.

### Logging
One can pass the logging verbosity level option to `pytype-single` to see the
logs:

```
$> out/bin/pytype-single -v<N> <other command like arguments>
```

For information about the logging levels, run `pytype-single --help`.

#### Logging from extension modules
The `pytype-single` executable makes use of few a C extension modules. Logging
from these extension modules is enabled only in debug builds. One can build
`pytype-single` in debug mode by passing the `--debug` option to the build
script as follows:

```
$> python build_scripts/build.py --debug
```

In a debug build of `pytype-single`, logging from extension modules follows the
same verbosity levels as the rest of the Python modules.

### Adding tests to your Changes
Ideally, every change should include a test. Depending on the type of your
change, you should either be adding a functional test or a unit test (some
changes might warrant both). Functional tests should be added in the
`pytype/tests` directory. Unit tests should be added in a test module next to
the module that is being tested.

Since Pytype already has exhaustive tests, a change will most likely need to
add a test method to an existing test module. In such a case, there is
nothing special required, other than just adding a new test method. If adding a
new test module is more meaningful, apart from adding the new test module, your
change should also add a `py_test` target to the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the
directory in which the test module lives. See existing `py_test` targets (in
`CMakeLists.txt` files) for examples on how to do this.

NOTE: Please see `pytype/tests/README.md` for more rules pertaining to adding
new functional tests.

### Running tests
There exists a convenience script to run Pytype tests. A typical usage of this
script is as follows:

```
$> python build_scripts/run_tests.py <TARGET>
```

`TARGET` is the fully qualified name of the test target within the root Pytype
source tree. If a target name is not specified, the script runs all `py_test`
and `cc_test` targets in the Pytype source tree.

For more information about `run_tests.py` options, run `run_test.py --help`.
